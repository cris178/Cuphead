# Cuphead Subreddit

This is the official CSS of the Cuphead Subreddit. It was made from scratch since before the game launched. The design was meant to mimick Cuphead himself with the red shorts and black top. Over time several features were added and will most likely continue to change forever. 

Reading this CSS is also a good way to get around to how everything is modified in order to significantly change a subreddit so use it as tutorial/study guide if you want. Some of the CSS is well commented, the images themselves on the other hand... 

### Prerequisites

If there are other redditors reading this who have no CSS experience I suggest taking a few lessons for free over at [Codecademy.](https://www.Codecademy.com) That's where I learned some of the basics and was the go to site my old CC used as HW for Web Design courses.  

## Getting Started

I suggest just starting off by reading the CSS. Some of the commented areas explain what is being affected with each line of code. 

A good way to change unknown parts of a sub reddit and how I did it was to use the Chrome developer tools. On Chrome right click on specific part of a sub and hit inspect element. You should see the html and CSS that a sub reddit has. More importantly you'll get to see the names of the divs you'll want to modify.
